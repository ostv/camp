In the last edition of 180 Creative Camp Abrantes, on July 2014, this creativity event hosted 20 young participants from 11 countries and 26 international renowned artists from different fields.

Some of these creators only know Portugal through the 180 Creative Camp experience and their image of the country is Abrantes, a quiet interior town that they would never think of visiting if they were spending their holidays in Portugal. This town, on its part, has some unique things to show after hosting two incredible editions of 180 Creative Camp.

Lots of talent traveled to Abrantes and locals and visitants witness it everyday on the painted walls by [Samina][1], [Lara Luís][2], [Wasted Rita][3], [Mr. Thoms][4] & [Chei Krew][5], on the quiet witnesses sculpted by [Isaac Cordal][6] and on the several collages by [Ella & Pitr][7], [Boris Hoppek][8] and [We Came From Space][9]. [Want to know more? [Visit 180 Creative Camp’s street art album on facebook][10].] All these artists - at least for one week - were thinking about Abrantes and about creative ways to stimulate it and improve it, for the benefit of its citizens.

Also ways to bring people to the stores of the historical center were put into practice thanks to the **Stores Attack Projects**. [Ece Canli’s][11] included a bit of Portuguese history in her [performance piece][11] at a local hairdresser, [Rubén Martín Hernández][12] - founder of adventure magazine [Dodo][13] - created [The Greatest Shop of Secrets in Abrantes][12].

[Eva Thinius][14] - with the help of LA illustrator [Vivan Shih][15] - designed the meeting point/map [“Somewhere in Abrantes”][16], [María Fernández Álvarez][17] baked some very good fortune cookies with special messages within for a local bakery and [Aïda Gómez][18] thought of a beautiful [thread intervention ][19] for the gate of the wool shop. [Antonina Dolani][20] and [Tania Reut][21] produced an incredible photography series that combines Portuguese traditions and fashion, aptly called ["Azulejos"][22], among many other wining ideas.

For 180 Creative Camp's [Open Call for Projects][23], a golden statue - ["KARAT"][24] - was constructed as a tribute to the origin of Abrantes' name and now a  [curtain of shoes][25] - "The 12 Thousand Pairs of Shoes From Abrantes" - and a web of mops - ["Silver Lining"][26] - protect two of the main squares against the blazing sun.
