180 Creative Camp hosts artists and aspiring young creators from all over the world in order to come up with different ways of thinking creatively. Through collaborations between imaginative minds from different backgrounds we achieve innovative and quality content, stuff that has never been thought, seen or tried before.

We’ve seen some great content emerge through the many editions of 180 Creative Camp. At the Abrantes 2014 edition, we hosted culture platform [Gestalten TV][1], represented by [Astrid Gleichmann][2] - who was shooting a documentary about multidisciplinary artist [Olaf Breuning][3] - and video project [Like Knows Like][4], represented by [Bas Berkhout][5], who in the meantime released [a mini-doc][6] about 180 Creative Camp Abrantes 2014 illustrator [Wasted Rita][7].

[RSI][8] (Radiotelevisione Svizzera), represented by Simona Picchi and Andrea Gnesutta, was one of the international media covering 180 Creative Camp Abrantes 2014, and their journalism piece, ["Cement eclipses"][9], focused on the work of Isaac Cordal, was recently released.

The motto of 180 Creative Camp is **Creative Collaborations in Media Arts** and we believe that the future of the media arts will be led by multidisciplinary artists and by the collaboration and creative mix of different artistic fields. The relationship between artists and aspiring creators starts during the event, where informality is privileged, and we have witnessed these relationships continue throughout the years, as the artists’ works keep growing.

Before, during and after each and every edition of the event, all related news (including constant updates about our network of artists) are posted on [180 Creative Camp's Facebook page][10]. The entire organization and coverage of 180 Creative Camp is in the hands of [Canal180′s][11] team.

**Watch for yourself the power of artistic collaborations!**
