# Artists in Residence · OLAF BREUNING

“An artist is someone who has an outside vision on the world” - [Olaf Breuning][8], multidisciplinary artist from Switzerland based in NYC, was one of the visionary artists-in-residence at 180 Creative Camp Abrantes 2014.

The first contact we had with Olaf was through [his works][9]. This contemporary artist cleverly combines humor, sexuality and even absurdity in his photos and sketches. He is influenced by simple human needs and our most basic moments. In person, he is as intriguing as his art. He speaks wisely of existential issues and the feature that best shows his humor are his eyes, which seem to have a permanent twinkle to them.

Olaf spent the first few days of 180 Creative Camp preparing all the elements for a photograph. The biggest challenge of his work, according to him, was to make sure everything would be perfect at the instant the shutter button was pressed, a moment that depended on the work of 180 Creative Camp’s team (including the event’s participants and team) and on the contribution of nature itself.

He recruited Brazilian participant [Giselle Galvão][10] to help him. [Astrid Gleichmann][11], who was shooting a documentary for [Gestalten TV][12], accompanied Olaf’s creative process throughout the week. The final work is [a picture][13] showing eight bodies painted in grey, red and white in front of a power plant, which is now traveling through social media and publications of the area.

For this photo, Olaf sought “neutral” bodies that would not distract the viewer from the image. He had a week to work on the concept (a “luxury”, according to the artist) and everything turned out perfectly. “The process went very well, it’s a photo for a lifetime and now is part of my family,” says Olaf.
