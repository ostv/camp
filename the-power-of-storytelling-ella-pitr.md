– You are pasting?  
– Yeah.  
– Let’s do it together and make children.  

[According to Pitr][1], this was the dialogue that unfolded the first time he met Ella and they started doing amazing street art [together][2]. This French duo met in Saint-Étienne and their style has been getting [bigger][3] ever since.

Storytelling must be in their minds the whole time they are drawing, because their work is based on characters: old men, ill people, fat ladies, birds and children (sometimes [_their_][4] children). Everywhere they go they create [photo backgrounds][5], where [everyone][6] is encouraged to take a picture and [send it to them][7].

Ella & Pitr are also getting more notice in the media. This past year they have been [repeatedly][8] [featured][9] in many [street art][10] [websites][11], and the huge drawing they created in the grass field next to the castle of Abrantes during 180 Creative Camp 2014 – [“When Children Sleep”][12], has been caught up in this buzz, being featured as one of the [most popular street art pieces of 2014.][13]

Besides the grass field, Ella & Pitr left their mark in [every corner of Abrantes][14], from doorbells to street signs. They refused to stop working during the hot summer week of the creativity event - if you got a glimpse of them, you’d see them [pasting][15], [pasting][16] and [pasting][17].
