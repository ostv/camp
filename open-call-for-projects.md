Right before 180 Creative Camp Abrantes 2014, an international open call was launched to select two urban intervention projects to be implemented in Abrantes, with the purpose of stimulating the historical center of the town. For this contest, [Canal180][1] teamed up with [ArchDaily][2] and with the [City Council of Abrantes][3] to select the two winning projects, which would be awarded €2.500 each. This value was destined to the construction of the projects by the authors during the week of 180 Creative Camp (July 13th to 20th).

By the end of the contest, 72 projects were submitted by authors from 18 different countries – among them Chile, Brazil, Germany and India. Projects [“KARAT”][4] and [“The 12 Thousand Pairs of Shoes From Abrantes”][5] were the [big winners][6]. An honorable mention was given to ["Silver Lining"][7], designed by locals Joana Borda d’Água and Joana Barbedo.

KARAT, designed by Francesco Bernabei (Italy) and Magnus Gustafsson (Sweden), consists of a golden installation made of rotating forms that evoke the history of the name “Abrantes”. Francesco and Magnus packed KARAT’s golden pieces in a van and left Florence on the dawn of July 13th and drove for 26 hours (sleeping only 3 hours!) to arrive in Abrantes on the next morning. After many hard hours of work, the sculpture was inaugurated in the same day.

"The 12 Thousand Pairs of Shoes From Abrantes”, by Spanish studio [Nodopía][8] (represented by Victor Lledó Garcia, Juan José Pérez Moncho and Mateo Fernández-Muro) recalls a war episode dated hundreds of years ago, when the inhabitants of the town had to give up their shoes to soldiers. It took almost the entire week of 180 Creative Camp and the valuable help of many volunteers and locals to [raise this curtain of shoes][9], which now creates shade over one of the main squares of the town.

All the submitted projects were exhibited the [Village Underground Lisbon][10] before the week of 180 Creative Camp and also in Abrantes during the creativity event. You can now check them all [via this link][11].
