After the success of the first two editions of 180 Creative Camp in Abrantes (the creativity event counts four editions overall), the town has become an unexpected urban art gallery with works of celebrated contemporary artists. Among them, [Ella&Pitr][1], [Florentijn Hofman][2], [Mr.THOMS][3], [AKACORLEONE][4], [Lara Luís][5] and [SAMINA][6].

Residents and visitors alike appreciate these pieces, stumbling upon them in the maze-like old streets of the town. Some of the most popular are the tiny suited men sculptures by street artist [Isaac Cordal][7], who uses his project [Cement Eclipses][8] to criticize society and its hierarchies and unfairness. (Swiss TV organization [RSI][9] was at 180 Creative Camp to accompany Isaac's work in Abrantes, [check their video report][10].)

The Cement Eclipses are hidden in the streets of Abrantes, however you can find them all though [this Goople Maps route][11], thought by Isaac, who walked the town with his camera and a huge stepladder in order to do the installations and document them afterwards.

180 Creative Camp makes use of forsaken or unused structures and uses the features of each location as inspiration. The event ends up [paying homage][12] to places that were until that moment abandoned or unnoticed, and it’s now a big part of the [identity of that spot][13], and even of the town itself. The  [humorous drawings][14] by [Boris Hoppek][15] and the [fresh honesty][16] of [Wasted Rita][17], for instance, are giving a new life to the old buildings.

Design collective [We Came From Space][18] contributed with their poetic view of typography. These artists gave a workshop with the purpose of illustrating the poem [“Dies Irae”][19] by the great Portuguese writer Miguel Torga, whose words can now be followed through the [streets][20], [squares][21] and [balconies][22] of the town.
